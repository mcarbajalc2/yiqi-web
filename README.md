## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version specified in `package.json`)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in the required values (see below for details)

5. Run database migrations:

   ```
   npm run migrate
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Environment Variables

Copy the contents of `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` and fill in the values:

- `CALLBACK`: OAuth callback URL
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google OAuth credentials
- `DIRECT_URL` and `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL database URLs
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`: AWS S3 credentials for file uploads
- Add any other required environment variables

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes and server actions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **API**: tRPC for type-safe API calls from native apps
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- **File Storage**: AWS S3
- **Email**: AWS SES
- **Payments**: Mercado Pago

## Development

- We use server actions instead of REST or GraphQL for most operations
- tRPC is used for connecting native apps
- Prisma is used for database migrations and ORM
- Zod is used for data validation

For more details on available scripts and dependencies, refer to `package.json`.

## Running Cron Jobs Locally

To simulate cron jobs locally, you can use the provided shell script. This script will call the cron routes every 2 minutes.

1. Make sure your local development server is running:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the project root.

3. Run the script:
   ```
   npm run run-crons
   ```

The script will continue running and calling the cron routes every 2 minutes until you stop it (use Ctrl+C to stop the script).

Note: Ensure that your local development server is running on `http://localhost:3000`. If you're using a different port or URL, update the `BASE_URL` in the `run-crons.sh` script accordingly.

## Notification System

Andino uses a queue-based notification system to handle various types of communications with users. The system is built around the `Notification` model in the database which acts as a queue for pending notifications.

### How it works

1. Notifications are queued by creating entries in the `Notification` table with:

   - Target user(s)
   - Organization context
   - Notification type (email, WhatsApp, etc)
   - Scheduled time to send
   - Additional data needed for the notification

2. A cron job regularly checks for pending notifications and processes them through the appropriate channels (email/WhatsApp)

### Architecture

- `src/lib/` contains the core notification logic and handlers
- `src/services/actions/` provides server actions that the frontend can use to queue notifications
- All incoming/outgoing data is validated using Zod schemas defined in `src/schemas/`
